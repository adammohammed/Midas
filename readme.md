Midas is a WIP project to have a local view of what markdown will look like once
rendered. There are other projects that do this, so this one is just for fun and
to learn some parsing grammar concepts.

## Working features

* Strong
* Unordered Lists
* Ordered Lists
* Emphasis
* Encoding html values (e.g ">" to "&gt;")

## Features on Deck

* Nested Lists
* Styling (?)
